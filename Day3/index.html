              <h1>Structure of URL</h1>
        
    <p>A URL is an address on the internet. It's made up of a protocol, domain name, amd a path. The Protocol is how the browser gets the information about that page, either http:// or https://. The subdomain is the part of the domain that comes before the main "root" domain. A URL is the address of a unique resource on the internet.</p><br>
     syntax:<b>scheme//:.domain:port/path/filename.</b>

    <h2>1)Explanation:</h2>
     scheme- defines the type of internet service(most common is http or https).<br>
     prefix- defines a domain prefix(default for http is www).<br>
     Domain- defines the internet domain name(like w3schools.com).<br>
     port- defines the port number at the host(default for http is 80).<br>
     path- defines a path at the server.<br>
     filename- defines the name of the document or resource.<br>
             <h1>Agile Methodology</h1>
     <p>A project management approach that involves breaking the project into phases and emphasizes continuous collaboration and improvement. Agile methodology is the cycle of planning, executing and evaluating.Helps to work efficiently by breaking down development process into smaller chunks. It helps to ensure that development teams complete projects on time and within budget.</p>
             <h1>Waterfall model</h1>
     <p> Waterfall model is also called as a linear model. It is also referred to as a linear-sequential life cycle model. The waterfall model is the earliest SDLC approach that was used for software development.</p>

     <h2>Phases:</h2>
      1)Requirement analysis- gather requirements and prepare SRS document.<br>
      2)system design- design some software into high level modules and low level modules.<br>
      3)Implementation-develop software<br>
      4)Testing- test the software.<br>
      5)Deployment- deploy the software.<br>
      6) Maintanance- start using the software<br>
           <h1>Software Development Life Cycle(SDLC)</h1>
      <p>Software development life cycle is process to design, develop and test the software.SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization. It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software. The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.</p>
       <h2>Stages:</h2>
       1)Planning and Requirement<br>
       2)Defining Requirements<br>
       3)Designing the product architecture<br>
       4)Building or developing the product<br>
       5)Testing the product<br>
       6)Deployment and Maintaince<br>
         <h1>Devops</h1> 
       <p>Devops is a combination of software development(dev) and operations(ops). It is defined as software engineering methodology which aims to integrate the work of development teams and operations teams by facilitating a culture of collaboration and shared responsibility.It allows a team to handle the complete application lifecycle, from development to testing, operations, and deployment. It shows cooperation between Development and Operations groups to deploy code to production quickly in an automated and repeatable manner.</p>
